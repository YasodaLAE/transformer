# ‚ö° Oversight: Transformer Control System

A comprehensive web application designed to manage, track, and analyze inspections of electrical transformers with AI-powered thermal anomaly detection. Both admins and viewers can monitor transformer data, inspection records, and gain automated insights from thermal image analysis.

Test data (6 transformers with baseline and thermal images) are included in the `Test Data` folder.

## üìë Features

### üîê Phase 1: Core Management System
- **Authentication System**: Local authentication to differentiate between regular users and administrators
- **Transformer Management**: 
  - Administrators can `view` `add` `edit` `delete` transformers and inspections
  - Administrators can `view` `upload` `delete` both thermal and baseline images
  - Regular users can view all data but cannot modify it
- **Inspection Workflow**: 
  - Update inspection status (`Pending`, `In Progress`, `Completed`)
  - Color-coded status badges (`Pending`: red, `In Progress`: green, `Completed`: blue)
- **Advanced Search**: 
  - Search transformers by number, location, and type
  - Search inspections by transformer number
  - Add inspections directly from the search interface

### ü§ñ Phase 2: AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
- **Automated Thermal Analysis**:
  - AI-based comparison engine that analyzes new maintenance images against baseline images
  - Automatic detection of thermal anomalies (temperature spikes, asymmetries, hotspot changes)
  - Intelligent thresholding mechanism to flag potential issues
- **Interactive Image Comparison**:
  - Side-by-side view of baseline and maintenance thermal images
  - Zoom, pan (click and drag), and reset controls
  - Visual anomaly highlighting with color-coded overlays and markers
- **Detailed Anomaly Metadata**:
  - Pixel coordinates and anomaly size information
  - Severity scores and confidence levels
  - Automatic annotation of detected anomalies
- **Performance Optimized**:
  - Fast model inference for responsive user experience
  - Modular architecture for future AI model improvements
  - Complete detection logs and metadata storage

## üéØ AI Detection Approach

### Anomaly Detection Logic
Our system employs a hybrid approach combining deep learning and computer vision techniques:

#### Deep Learning Component (YOLO Model)
- **Custom-trained YOLOv model** for real-time anomaly detection and automatic annotation
- Trained specifically on thermal transformer images to identify:
  - Hotspots and temperature anomalies
  - Structural abnormalities
  - Component degradation patterns
- Provides accurate bounding boxes and confidence scores for detected anomalies
- Optimized architecture for fast inference on thermal imagery

#### Computer Vision Optimization
- **Advanced thresholding techniques** applied post-detection to:
  - Filter false positives
  - Enhance detection accuracy
  - Reduce overall inference time
- Pixel-wise temperature comparison between baseline and maintenance images

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Thermal images are normalized and prepared for model input
2. **YOLO Detection**: Deep learning model identifies potential anomaly regions
3. **Computer Vision Refinement**: Thresholding and filtering optimize detection results
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Each detection includes reliability metrics
5. **Automatic Annotation**: Bounding boxes and labels are generated on detected anomalies
6. **Metadata Extraction**: Coordinates, size, severity, and confidence data are captured
