# ‚ö° Oversight: Transformer Control System

A comprehensive web application designed to manage, track, and analyze inspections of electrical transformers with AI-powered thermal anomaly detection. Both admins and viewers can monitor transformer data, inspection records, and gain automated insights from thermal image analysis.

Test data (5 transformers with baseline and thermal images) are included in the `Test Data` folder.

---

## üìë Features

### üîê Phase 1: Core Management System
- Local authentication to differentiate between regular users and administrators
- Administrators can `view` `add` `edit` `delete` transformers and inspections
- Administrators can `view` `upload` `delete` both thermal and baseline images
- Regular users can view all data but cannot modify it
- Update inspection status (`Pending`, `In Progress`, `Completed`)
- Color-coded status badges (`Pending`: red, `In Progress`: green, `Completed`: blue)
- Search transformers by number, location, and type
- Search inspections by transformer number
- Add inspections directly from the search interface

### ü§ñ Phase 2: AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
- AI-based comparison engine that analyzes new maintenance images against baseline images
- Automatic detection of thermal anomalies (temperature spikes, asymmetries, hotspot changes)
- Visual anomaly highlighting with color-coded overlays and markers
- Side-by-side view of baseline and maintenance thermal images
- Zoom, pan (click and drag), and reset controls
- Pixel coordinates, Severity scores, and confidence levels

### ‚úèÔ∏è Phase 3: Interactive Annotation & Feedback Loop

The system now incorporates an **interactive annotation layer** to allow administrators to validate and correct AI-generated detections, creating high-quality ground-truth data for continuous model improvement.

#### Annotation System Description
The anomaly detection view is equipped with intuitive tools enabling users to refine the output of AI model:
- Users can **resize and reposition** existing AI detected anomaly markers.
- Users can **draw new bounding boxes** to mark missed anomalies.
- Users can **delete** incorrectly detected anomaly markers.

All annotation actions are **automatically logged** with detailed metadata, ensuring full data traceability and removing the need for a manual save step.

#### Feedback Integration for Model Improvement
- All user modified annotations are stored alongside the original AI predictions in a dedicated log.
- An administrator control in the dashboard allows triggering a backend process to **convert the complete annotation log into a YOLO-compatible dataset structure** and fine tune the existing model, directly using the human feedback.
- The complete feedback log and individual logs are exportable in **JSON format**, containing Image ID, original AI output, final accepted annotations, and annotator metadata.

## ü§ñ YOLO Model Training
### Training Script
The project includes a custom YOLO training script (`yolo.py`) for training the anomaly detection model on thermal transformer images.

#### Model Fine-Tuning with Feedback Data
The mechanism for improvement is the fine-tuning process, which can be triggered by an administrator from the **Dashboard** page.

1. A backend service queries the `Annotations` table to compile all user-modified data.
2. The service processes this data into the standard **YOLO text file structure** (normalized coordinates and class ID).
3. The Python `finetune_yolo.py` script is executed on the server, using the new human validated dataset for fine-tuning the existing model weights.
4. The resulting best model weights are saved, ready to replace the old model for subsequent inference runs.
5. Whenever new fine tuning is done, best model path used in the `detector.py` for detections, is changed, which is given from the backend.

## üíæ Backend Structure Used to Persist Annotations

Annotations and their associated feedback metadata are stored in a structured relational database (MySQL) to ensure traceability and queryability.
