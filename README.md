# ‚ö°Oversight : Transformer Control System

A web application designed to manage and track inspections of electrical transformers.  
Both admins and viewers can monitor transformer data, inspection records, and gain insights from thermal image analysis.

---

## üìë Features
- A local authentication system to differentiate between regular users and administrators.
- Administrators can `view` `add` `edit` `delete` transformers and inspections, and `view` `upload` `delete` both thermal and baseline images.
- Regular users can view all data but cannot modify it.
- Update the status of an inspection (`Pending`, `In Progress`, `Completed`).
- Colored status badges for inspections (`Pending`: red, `In Progress`: green, `Completed`: blue).
- Can search in the list of `All Transformers` by transformer number, location and transformer type.
- Can search in the list of `All Inspections` by transformer number and add inspections directly from that page.
